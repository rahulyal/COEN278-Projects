**Question 1**

Redefine the following method of Array class: 

a. Array#select 

b. Array#map

c. Array#reverse

**Answer**

```ruby
class Array
    # redefine to exactly how select method works
    def my_select
        result = []
        # << is used for appending item onto a list
        each { |item| result << item if yield(item) }
        result
    end
    # redefine to exactly how map method work
    def my_map
        result = []
        each {|item| result << yield(item)}
        result
    end
    # redefine to exactly how reverse method work
    def my_reverse
        result = []
        (size - 1).downto(0) { |i| result << self[i] }
        result
    end
end
  

nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
even = nums.my_select{|x| x.even?}
double = nums.my_map{|x| 2*x}
reverse = nums.my_reverse()
original_even = nums.select{|x| x.even?}
original_double = nums.map{|x| 2*x}
original_reverse = nums.reverse()
print(even,original_even,"\n")
print(double,original_double,"\n")
print(reverse,original_reverse)
```

The following showcases the output and is checked against the original inbuilt methods and my methods, which do the same thing.

the source code for all the problems will be attached individually

```ruby
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode
#     attr_accessor :val, :next
#     def initialize(val = 0, _next = nil)
#         @val = val
#         @next = _next
#     end
# end
# @param {ListNode} list1
# @param {ListNode} list2
# @return {ListNode}
def merge_two_lists(l1, l2)
    dummy_head = ListNode.new(0)
    current = dummy_head

    while l1 && l2
        if l1.val <= l2.val
            current.next = l1
            l1 = l1.next
        else
            current.next = l2
            l2 = l2.next
        end
        current = current.next
    end

  # Attach remaining nodes from either list
    current.next = l1 || l2

    return dummy_head.next
end
```

**Question 3** 

Write a class for compressing a sentence. By compress a sentence, we mean to remove duplicate words. For example, a sentence "i love you but do you love me" will be compressed into "i love you but do me". When you create an object of this class, you pass a sentence argument (a string), then the object is initialized with the compressed result of this string as the attribute of the object. The compressed result will be saved in an array of each word of the initial sentence. You also need another array to remember index of word in compressed array for decompress purpose. For example: assuming the name of your class is Compress, to create an object: obj = Compress.new(“i love you but do you love me”) #there are duplicate words in it then there will be two attributes created inside the object to hold two values: [“i”, “love”, “you”, “but”, “do”, “me”] # duplicate word removed (compressed) [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1, 5] # index to the original array to represent original sentence You task: add an instance method to return the original string (not compressed)

**Answer**

```ruby
class Compress
    attr_accessor :compressed_sentence, :index_array
  
    def initialize(sentence)
        @compressed_sentence = []
        @index_mapping = {}
        words = sentence.split
        compressed_index = 0

        words.each do |word|
            unless @index_mapping.key?(word)
                @compressed_sentence << word
                @index_mapping[word] = compressed_index
                compressed_index += 1
            end
        end

        @index_array = words.map { |word| @index_mapping[word] }
    end

    def decompress
        original_sentence = @index_array.map { |index| @compressed_sentence[index] }
        original_sentence.join(' ')
    end
end

#example
sentence = "i love you but do you love me"
compressor = Compress.new(sentence)
puts "Compressed Sentence: #{compressor.compressed_sentence}"
puts "Index Array: #{compressor.index_array}"
puts "Decompressed Sentence: #{compressor.decompress}"
```

Running the above file gives out the following result:
